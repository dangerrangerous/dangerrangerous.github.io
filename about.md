Hey there! I'm a software developer by experience
with a formal education in operations management. We are alive during a time where the
 tools to create allow us to do amazing things and show each other how
 we did it. I've made this blog in an attempt to record and share with others.
 
 I enjoy getting outside, lifting weights, creating shitty digital art, gaming with friends,
and obscure beer leagues.

See you, space cowboy.
