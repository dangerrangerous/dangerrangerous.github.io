Hey there! I'm a software developer by experience
with an education in Operations Management. We are alive during a time where the
 tools to build software allow us to do amazing things and show each other how
 we did it. I've made this blog in an attempt to record and share my learning,
experiences, ideas, and adventures.

See you later, space cowboy.
