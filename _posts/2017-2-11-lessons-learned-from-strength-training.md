title: Lessons Learned from Strength Training
---

### Simple life lessons learned from lifting heavy things
So either you already pick things up and set them down or you're interested in
how picking things up and setting them down can improve your mentality, what
of it? At a certain point you will likely want to pick up heavier things and you
will realize that in order to get to that point you will have to change some
things to ascend to the next level. Here are some key take-aways I've gained
from strength training that can be applied elsewhere in life when you're trying
to break a plateau.

### * Show Up
Seems simple but this is the most important point. It doesn't matter how good
your plan is if you don't show up in the first place. Whether it's programming,
painting, pushups, or learning a new skill, showing up is half the battle. Set a
 small, achievable goal such as writing 1 line of code, drawing a smiley face,
 or doinga couple of pushups. This will remove the mindset of "oh man, I don't
 want to do X activity because doing 100% of X activity is a drain!" And once
 you show up and surpass your easy goal, you will more then likely be able to
 push yourself further and feel good about it. It is from this base that you
 will begin to form good habits that will grow with more structure.

### * Have a plan
Here is the structure that will grow your habits. If you don't have a plan it
is easy to find yourself going in circles. In strength training we have the
luxury that there are many plans readily available that can be modified
to fit your goals. This is not always the case when learning a new skill. You
may have to create your own plan. I will help walk you through what this process
can look like.
* Write down your goal. Ex: Learn and play an entire song from memory. We will
 work backwards from this point.
* Give your goal a time frame. Ex: 2 weeks.
* Break your goal down into individual, achievable units. Ex: Learn main riff,
memorize lyrics, learn verse, learn intro, and so on.
* Give these units a place in time. Some things are best learned on their own
while others benefit from overall practice, we call this connected benefit
"carry over". Ex: The verse may be similar to the intro, and by learning the
verse you will already be familiar with the intro. That said, make sure you
create a time frame for when these goals should be completed. Unless you plan on
competing, it's OK to fail the 'deadline', adjust accordingly.
* Assemble the units. You can play the part, you can sing the track. Now put
them together! "Oh no! Turns out this is a skill within itself! Doing multiple
things at once is hard! I am a failure and my plan sucks!" Or alternatively,
"everything has gone well and I am a glowing musical unicorn."
* Iterate. This boils down to fail faster and adjust your plan accordingly.
In the long run it is better to be crappy at playing 100 songs then it is to be
good at playing 1 song well in a given timeline. Just be sure to take the skills
gained from the 100 garbage songs and apply the experience towards creating
something of high quality.
* Learn what makes a good plan for you personally. This is an important point,
everyone learns differently and the mind-body-spirit connection will respond
to stimuli uniquely to various inputs. Whether it's weight training, app
security, meditation, or eating 100 hotdogs - have a plan! It doesn't have to
be good, it just has to exist. You can improve it over time. Think of it as a
personal contract or diary. Today you owe yourself 2 pushups, or one new guitar
chord.

### * Understand that results take time
Real results take time. Generally speaking, if it was easily earned, it will be
easily lost. If you're new thinking you are going to get the body you want in 3
months I will be the first to tell you "newp". But don't let that stop you. The
years will pass whether you are working towards your goals or not. So do it now!

### * Track your results
That which gets measured, gets improved. If you're painting, save your canvases.
Learning an instrument, take videos. In strength training there is a thing
called "PR's", personal records. Record personal records for yourself, and beat
them.

### * Be around people with similar goals
This will help keep you motivated, give you new goals to work towards, teach you
new techniques, inspire you, and act as a sort of support group of people who
you can relate to. You can go it alone but you won't make it as
far as you would with people holding you accountable. Put yourself out there!

### * Don't be afraid to ask for a spot
If you don't have a "lifting partner", this is where being around people with
similar goals will really help you. You may be taking on a new challenge that is
beyond your current skill set, the equivalent of a new bench press pr. Look
around and don't be afraid to ask for help. Along those same lines, don't
hesitate to offer help to others. We get stronger together than we do alone.

### * Leverage the power of momentum
Lastly leverage the awesome powers of momentum. Little things each day have a
compounding effect, think of it as interest that builds up off of itself. If you
put in a lot of work in the early stages all you have to do is show up to
 maintain that momentum.
