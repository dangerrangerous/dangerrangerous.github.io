title: Build a Blog with Jekyll
---

### The what:
Build a Blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) - a simple, static, blog-aware
website builder that is hosted by [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com). We
can customize our Jekyll site or take the easy route and download one of the
many [themes](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) available.

### The why:
Jekyll supports mobile friendly themes.
Hosting via Github Pages is free.
Since we are tied into Github, source control is already baked in.
Post are composed of static files, jekyll does the rest of the work for us.
You're setting up for a play on words in a later blog post...

### The how:
* Make sure you have ruby and ruby-dev tools installed on your machine. You
may have to use 'sudo'.
<div class="message">
sudo apt-get install ruby
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
</div>

* Install jekyll on your machine
<div class="message">
sudo apt-get instll jekyll
</div>

* Download your theme of choice. For this example we will use
[Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)
* Change directory name to yourgithubusername.github.io and run
<div class="message">
yourusername.github.io jekyll build
yourusername.github.io jekyll serve
</div>

The default port is set to 4000 so open your browser of choice and type in
localhost:4000

Hopefully things are working! If they aren't, don't panic. I encountered some
errors that I resolved by following directions listed in the issues section
of the github repository. Take a deep breath and do some googling.

Now you can open the folder labeled posts and create a new .md file. Use the
existing posts as examples of how to format yours.

Once you've got a post you'll want to push the changes to Github. Follow the
directions for setting up a [Github page](https://pages.github.com). If you
don't have a Github account, git one.
