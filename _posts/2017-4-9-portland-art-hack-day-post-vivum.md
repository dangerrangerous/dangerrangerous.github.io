title: Portland's Art Hack Day Post Vivum

### [How many likes makes a truth?](http://www.arthackday.net/events/echo-chamber)

Participating in Portland Oregon’s flavor of Art Hack Day, Echo Chamber, was entirely its own unique experience. 60 art hacking hacker artists together under one roof with 48 hours to produce an exhibit open to the public by Sunday.

So what is Art Hack Day? In its own words,

### “Art Hack Day is an internet-based nonprofit dedicated to hackers whose medium is art and artists whose medium is tech.”

 I ended up joining a small team that was really a team-within-a-team backed by, for lack of better terms, gurus and advisors that would help when we hit roadblocks. Our team leveraged motion detection from an [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) package in [Processing](https://processing.org/) and wired it up to a [teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) board running some C code for light animations. The end result illuminated the wall above guests heads when they walked through an entrance where we had our camera pointed, and if there was no movement for a given time the lights would generate colorful twinkle patterns. Sparkly.

It was the first time I had heard so many ideas bounce off of people to be absorbed, pulled apart, reformed, and regenerated into physical, audio, visual, and often interactive creations. It was rad.

### Art hack day’s are not something that can be captured or described in a small amount of text

There were Dance Dance Emoticon VR stations drenched in lasers and projections, games of healing, interactive controller projections, screaming zones, calming and mild hallucination inducing light boxes, tinfoil and drum pads, hololenses combined with cardboard tree with foil leafing, kinect powered rainbow silhouettes, generative art, something I can only describe as an igloo, more projections, reflective pieces, analog exhibits, monster dating cards, an art critic bot using markov chains, arguing digital furbies, an actual furbie, a toilet chair, a VR bathtub, artsy finger pointing self blame face swap, colored water blob bird bath, and a facebook memory scraper that displayed the famous last words between people who haven’t messaged each other in years.

My kind of jam. I’d like to extend a special thanks to the people who worked hard to put on the event, as well as the sponsors for their provisions, good local food and beer included.

If you’ve been on the fence about participating in something like this, sign up and show up. Just witnessing creations grow from what I will describe as input-output madness is inspiring, let alone being around that many artists and makers. Otherwise if you’re in the area you should definitely drop in on these kind of events, it’s pretty amazing to see what can be accomplished over the weekend.

Oh and in case the article bias scoring project get’s pointed at this post here are some words: Glorious, whimsical, victorious, exuberant, magnificent, lavish, great, terrific, exceptional, tireless, boundless, hopeful, bing, joyful, masterpiece, success.
